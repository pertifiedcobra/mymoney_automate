MyMoneyPro Automation ScriptThis script automates the process of adding expense entries to the "MyMoneyPro" Android application. It reads transaction data from a predefined list, connects to an Android phone via USB, and simulates user taps and inputs to create new entries automatically.The script is designed to be robust and intelligent, using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to find UI elements by their text. It also includes a caching mechanism to dramatically speed up the process on subsequent runs.Table of ContentsPrerequisitesPart 1: Computer SetupPart 2: Phone SetupPart 3: Project Configuration (Crucial Step)Part 4: Data ConfigurationPart 5: Running the ScriptHow the Cache WorksTroubleshootingPrerequisitesBefore you begin, ensure you have the following:An Android phone with the MyMoneyPro app installed.A computer (Windows, macOS, or Linux).A USB cable to connect your phone to the computer.Part 1: Computer SetupThis section covers the installation of all necessary software and libraries on your computer.Step 1: Install PythonThe script requires Python 3.Open your terminal (Command Prompt/PowerShell on Windows, Terminal on macOS/Linux).Run python --version or python3 --version.If you don't have Python installed, download it from python.org.Windows Users: During installation, it is very important to check the box that says "Add Python to PATH".Step 2: Install Tesseract-OCR EngineThis is the core OCR engine that reads text from the screen.Windows:Download the installer from the official Tesseract repository at UB Mannheim.Run the installer. Ensure you check the option to add Tesseract to your system PATH.macOS:Install Homebrew from brew.sh if you don't have it.In Terminal, run: brew install tesseractLinux (Debian/Ubuntu):In your terminal, run: sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocrStep 3: Install Android Debug Bridge (ADB)This tool allows your computer to communicate with your phone.Download the "SDK Platform-Tools" for your OS from the official Android Developer website.Unzip the file into a permanent location (e.g., C:\platform-tools on Windows).Add the full path to this folder to your system's PATH environment variable. This is a critical step that allows you to run adb from any terminal.Step 4: Install Python LibrariesOpen your terminal and run the following command to install all the Python packages required by the script:pip install loguru pytesseract pillow opencv-python numpy
Part 2: Phone SetupConfigure your Android phone to accept automation commands.Step 1: Enable Developer OptionsGo to Settings > About phone.Find the Build number and tap it seven times consecutively. You will see a toast message saying, "You are now a developer!".Step 2: Enable USB DebuggingGo back to the main Settings menu.Navigate to System > Developer options.Find and turn on the USB debugging toggle.Step 3: Connect and AuthorizeConnect your phone to your computer with the USB cable.A pop-up will appear on your phone asking to "Allow USB debugging?".Check the box for "Always allow from this computer" and tap "Allow".Step 4: Verify ConnectionOn your computer, open a new terminal.Run the command: adb devicesYou should see your device's serial number listed with the word "device" next to it. If it says "unauthorized," you need to re-authorize it on your phone.Part 3: Project Configuration (Crucial Step)This is the most important part of the setup. You must tell the script the exact coordinates of the buttons on your specific phone's screen.Step 1: Enable Pointer LocationOn your phone, go back to Settings > System > Developer options.Find the Pointer location option (under the "Input" section) and turn it on.Now, when you touch the screen, a bar will appear at the top showing the live X and Y coordinates of your touch.Step 2: Find and Update CoordinatesOpen the money_automator.py script in a text editor.Locate the AppCoordinates class.Go through each UI element in the app and touch it to get its coordinates. Update the corresponding variable in the AppCoordinates class.Checklist of Coordinates to Find:initiate_new_entry_coords: The main + button on the home screen.save_button_coords: The ✓ SAVE checkmark at the top of the "Add Expense" screen.account_entry_coords: The "Account" button.category_entry_coords: The "Category" button.date_picker_entry_coords: The date display button.time_picker_entry_coords: The time display button.notes_section_coords: The "Add notes" text area.keypad_coords: Get the center coordinates for each number ('0' to '9') and the decimal (.) on the on-screen keypad.backspace_coords: The backspace ⌫ button next to the amount.date_month_change_coords: The < ("prev") and > ("next") arrows in the date picker.date_ok_coords: The "OK" button in the date picker.time_keypad_mode_coords: The small keyboard icon in the time picker.time_hour_coords & time_minute_coords: The hour and minute text fields in the time picker's keypad mode.time_ampm_selector_coords: The AM/PM dropdown button.time_ampm_coords: The coordinates for the "AM" and "PM" options after the dropdown is opened.time_ok_coords: The "OK" button in the time picker.Part 4: Data ConfigurationInside the if __name__ == '__main__': block at the bottom of the script, you'll find the transactions_to_add list.Structure: Each transaction is a Python dictionary.account & category: These strings must exactly match the text displayed in the app, including spaces and capitalization (e.g., "HSBC CC", "HDFC - Special Gold").datetime: This must be a Python datetime object. You can create it using datetime(...) or datetime.strptime(...) as shown in the examples.Part 5: Running the ScriptConnect your phone to your computer via USB.Unlock your phone and manually open the MyMoneyPro app to its main screen.On your computer, open a terminal and navigate to the folder where you saved the script.Run the script with the command:python money_automator.py
The script will wait 5 seconds and then begin the automation. Do not touch your phone or computer while it is running.How the Cache WorksThe script creates a ui_cache.json file to store the locations of accounts and categories it finds.The first time it looks for "HSBC CC," it will be slow as it uses OCR.After finding it, it saves the coordinates to the cache.The next time it needs to find "HSBC CC," it will read the coordinates from the cache and tap them instantly.If you add, remove, or reorder accounts/categories, you can simply delete the ui_cache.json file to force the script to re-learn the layout.Troubleshooting"Tesseract is not installed or it's not in your PATH": This is the most common error.Make sure you installed Tesseract correctly.Ensure you added it to your system PATH and have opened a new terminal since doing so.As a last resort, uncomment and edit the pytesseract.pytesseract.tesseract_cmd line at the top of the script to point directly to your Tesseract installation.adb: command not found: You did not add the platform-tools folder to your system PATH correctly.Script fails to find an account/category:Check the logs to see the "Searchable Text Block." This will show you what the OCR is actually reading.Ensure the account or category string in your transactions_to_add list is an exact match for what's on the screen.
